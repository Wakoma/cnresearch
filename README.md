# Community Network Research

  This is a curated list of resources, organizations, hardware, apps/services, platforms, etc. for community/mesh/wireless networks.  It draws from [this public and editable spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UUayyvi11CTtCqs2v71Xysh2UZwB2dJRDYhfebjNsBw/edit?usp=sharing) from [Wakoma](http://www.wakoma.co/).  The list is pretty ugly right now, and there are plenty of errors and omissions, but with your help this will improve over time.

  Contributions are very encouraged, as are suggestions for making this resource more useful.

## Current Process:
* Make additions/changes in this sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UUayyvi11CTtCqs2v71Xysh2UZwB2dJRDYhfebjNsBw/edit?usp=sharing
* Name, Website and Description columns are converted to markdown in column M
* Tab 2 provides a list of tentative Section and Sub-Section names.  (Please make comments/suggestions here!)
* Tab 3 takes markdown from Tab 1, and organizes into Sections
* Columns from Tab 3 are copy-pasted to README (here) (Tips on doing this automatially?)

**Note:**
*We've done things this way to make it very simple for anyone in the community to make contributions.*  We will soon generate a website out of this content using GitHub pages. 

We also have a list of CN-related individuals, but will create an opt-in Sheet/Form for people to add their own names.


## Credits

The approach for linking Sheets to GitHub was influenced by [Gabriel Krieshok](https://github.com/gabrielkrieshok) and his incredible [ICT4D Guide](https://github.com/gabrielkrieshok/ict4dguide).

Thanks to [Dirk Uys](https://github.com/dirkcuys) for technical input
